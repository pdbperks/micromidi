# micromidi
A BBC microbit bluetooth midi controller written in MakeBlock.

“I used the iOS micro:bit app to pair the board with my iPad. In the app tap Choose micro:bit then tap Pair a new micro:bit. For the initial pairing you need to hold down the Micro:bit buttons A and B, then press and release the reset key on the back. Wait until the lights have filled the screen and follow the instructions provided by the app. You will need to go to Settings/Bluetooth and connect the BBC micro:bit under MyDevices: I find that I have to repeat this every time I want to connect to the iPad. 

I have successfully used several synthesizer apps with the Micro:bit and would recommend the Minimoog Model D app or Audikit Synth One. In the Minimoog app, click the settings cog icon in the top right hand corner, select MIDI option and click the Bluetooth Midi button to list and connect your device.”

Button A plays random note from pentatonic scale. Minimoog version uses tilt action to select note.

Button B cycles though instruments.

Roll tilt micro:Bit for pitch bend.

Shine light on micro:bit for modulation.

Any suggestions for development of the MicroMIDI instrument will be very welcome.
